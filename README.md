## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Mikhail I'm mainly using python right now.
I started with python when I was young and a like to use it for a lot of my projects, but I'm also learning C and C++.
I'm always trying to come up with a new project or idea that teaches me how to use something new whether that be a new library or a new language.
