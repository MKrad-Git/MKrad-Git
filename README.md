Hello, my name is Mikhail, I have been using Python for 8+ years for personal projects. I am currently enrolled in the University of Massachusetts Lowell Honors Computer Science Program learning C and C++. My biggest achievement is a proffitable trading algorithm. I am always looking to learn more whether itâ€™s additional programming languages or different projects to continue developing my skills and capabilities.
